##Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

##This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course in Coursera. The R script,  run_analysis.R , does the ##following:
##1.Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory
##2.Load the activity and feature information
##3.Load the training and test datasets, keeping only the columns reflecting mean or standard deviation
##4.Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
##5.Merges the two datasets
##6.Converts the  activity  and  subject  columns into factors
##7.Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

##The end result is shown in the file  tidy.txt.
